DEV NOTES — ROAD TRAVELED (v0.2)
===============================

This file records architectural decisions that must remain stable.

---

1) CORE PRINCIPLES
-----------------
- Separate LOGIC from RENDERING
- Player object is the source of spatial truth
- Avoid premature visuals
- Systems must compose cleanly
- Prefer flags over fixed properties

---

2) TILE FLAGS
-------------
Tiles store logical state via a Set.

Examples:
- active
- blocked
- discovered
- city
- quest

Flags are semantic state, never visuals.

---

3) ACTIVE TILE vs CURSOR
-----------------------
ACTIVE TILE:
- Persistent
- One at a time
- Represents world focus

CURSOR:
- Temporary
- Used for navigation / selection
- May be disabled depending on scene

This separation enables RTS-style control,
pathfinding, and multiplayer logic.

---

4) WORLD & ATLAS TRANSLATION
----------------------------
- Overworld tiles are world-space coordinates
- Minimap tiles are world-space at higher resolution
- 20×20 minimap tiles equal 1 overworld tile
- Translator handles all atlas communication

---

5) VIEWPORT CONTRACT
--------------------
- Scenes declare viewport in tiles, not pixels
- SceneManager enforces canvas resolution
- Canvas CSS size always matches buffer size
- Browser container never clips gameplay

---

6) CAMERA PHILOSOPHY
--------------------
- Camera centers the world, not the canvas
- Spawn logic determines initial centering
- Fog of war will operate relative to camera window
- Expansion adds tiles beyond view, not resizing view

---

SAVE POINT
----------
Version 0.2 is a stable architectural checkpoint.

World logic, camera logic, and rendering contracts
are considered locked.

Future work should build on these rules.
